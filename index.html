                        <p>The FILLIN.AI team at the leadersofdigital.ru hackathon has developed a program for detecting cheating on online exams. Using modern approaches of artificial intelligence, it recognizes the user,
                            monitors his actions during the exam, and conduct an analysis for cheating. The service determines the substitution of a student during the exam, the direction of gaze, the presence of people nearby,
                            copying text, leaving the mouse outside the browser window. FILLIN.AI is a cloud-based solution,
                            you just need to start your exam in a browser and the service will start analyzing. Webrtc technology is used to transfer data from a web camera and monitor. My task in the team was web development.</p>

                        <p>Secret Agent is a solution for protecting copyrights of digital content on the Internet. The program was developed within the framework of a grant received from the Innovation promotion fund fasie.ru.
                            Using steganographic techniques, the program inserts a digital watermark in images and videos. The watermark is invisible to humans and contains information about the user who downloaded the content. If a client illegally distributes the file, the offender can be identified by the ID contained in the file. The system is resistant to file format changes, slight degradation of image quality and addition of noise.</p>
